This is a CPU-based tiny ray tracer capable of rendering basic geometric primitives like spheres, planes, and cubes. I developed this project entirely from scratch in C++, implementing core features such as ray-object intersections, shading, and interactive camera control through mouse movement, to explore and demonstrate the fundamental principles behind modern 3D rendering and game development
